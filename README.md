# italki teacher searcher
 
italki.com it's really cool platform which provides you to learn a language with a native speakers
 
## Problem
It provides inbuilt search but you can't sort teachers by their real lowest price. Seems to be it shows the teacher average hour price. Some teachers have 30 min and 45 min lessons but some teachers don't. So you should open each teacher profile then open each teacher lesson type and check the lowest price there
 
## Solution
By default the script searches English native speakers. If you want to modify some parameters please find it in script constants at the beginning of the script.
1. Copy all content of the `index.js`
1. Open https://italki.com in your browser
1. Open developer tools (usually press `F12`)
1. Open `Console` tab
1. Paste copied script content
1. Press `Enter` key
1. Wait. It takes from 25 sec (depends on your internet speed)
